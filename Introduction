Here lies a document that I shall be writing about my job hunt and in this process what all I learnt.

I learnt that I should be more sincere and more hard working. Grab every opportunity that demands a new thing to learn and learn it without any hesitation. Sharpen skills and be on par with industry demands. Always be proactive, don't wait for someone to give you a task to do, feel the need, create a ticket and start working. Talk to everyone in the organisation, need not be work specific, can be anything.
